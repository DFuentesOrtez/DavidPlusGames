                                    <p>*Just for context. I played about 37 hours in my first playthrough but my save
                                        was deleted so I restarted with a different build*</p>
                                    <p>I underestimated the length of this game. There are way more bosses than the
                                        first game. Though that can provide a variety in combat, many bosses were easy
                                        and boring. The common enemies were more difficult than some bosses.</p>
                                    <p>The most annoying part of the game was adventuring, some places were cool but
                                        irritating to get through, or just long.</p>
                                    <p>Besides those dislikes. The game graphically was similar to the first, though I
                                        would say I loved some of the backgrounds in many parts of the map where you had
                                        a chance to overlook the land.</p>
                                    <p>The combat was okay, nothing too different. Though I felt like some of the hit
                                        detection was way off. Also the camera felt awful, absolutely hated it but found
                                        a fix which made it a lot better.</p>
                                    <p>Overall I decently enjoyed the game but at a certain point I just wanted to get
                                        it over with.</p>

                                    <p>This game is amazing.</p>
                                    <p>The art style and world is great. Playing as pinnochio in a world full of evil
                                        puppets. The story is easy to follow, it's clear what you are there to do as you
                                        progress through the game. The world as a whole was dark and scary in places
                                        that seem like they used to be so bright and joyful.</p>
                                    <p>The system in the game was just as you would expect from a soulslike game so
                                        there's not much to explain there. But one thing is that the game is more linear
                                        than a typical souls game, the game will always lead you to where you should go
                                        and you do bosses in a certain order.</p>
                                    <p>The combat and movement were great and smooth, everything felt quick, responsive,
                                        and especially satisfying. I kind of wish there was more variety in the classes
                                        and weapons but nonetheless I enjoyed my dexterity run.</p>
                                    <p>This game is amazing and does justice to the souls genre.</p>

                                    <p>This game's art style is cute and simple. I did not think I would get as invested
                                        in this game as I did.</p>
                                    <p>At first I didn't think too much of it but was still enjoying it. But the
                                        dialogue got me slightly more invested over time, a lot of the time it was funny
                                        but at times it got deep. The story was sad and had me attached.
                                    <p>The "levels" were pretty creative, they weren't too difficult yet they were
                                        enjoyable. The combat was simple with it being a hack n slash type of game. And
                                        there wasn't much variety in weapons. The boss fights were pretty fun and had
                                        good variety in design and attacks.</p>
                                    <p>Overall I enjoyed the game, my favorite part being the dialogue.</p>

                                    <p>The art style in this game is 10/10. So cute and sick at the same time. One of my
                                        favorite parts.</p>
                                    <p>The combat in this game was simple yet fun, the mechanics introduced over time
                                        made the combat more fun over time, letting you be more agile and try out
                                        different weapons.</pp>
                                    <p>The world was fun to explore, I loved the secret passages all around, letting you
                                        take some shortcuts once you get through areas to help you traverse more
                                        quickly.</p>
                                    <p>Some aspects were definitely souls inspired, like the fox statues acting as
                                        bonfires which also restored your flasks. Souls-like components are usually a
                                        plus for me.</p>
                                    <p>I really enjoyed playing through this game.</p>
