                                <p>*Just for context. I played about 37 hours in my first playthrough but my save
                                    was deleted so I restarted with a different build*</p>
                                <p>I underestimated the length of this game. There are way more bosses than the
                                    first game. Though that can provide a variety in combat, many bosses were easy
                                    and boring. The common enemies were more difficult than some bosses.</p>
                                <p>The most annoying part of the game was adventuring, some places were cool but
                                    irritating to get through, or just long.</p>
                                <p>Besides those dislikes. The game graphically was similar to the first, though I
                                    would say I loved some of the backgrounds in many parts of the map where you had
                                    a chance to overlook the land.</p>
                                <p>The combat was okay, nothing too different. Though I felt like some of the hit
                                    detection was way off. Also the camera felt awful, absolutely hated it but found
                                    a fix which made it a lot better.</p>
                                <p>Overall I decently enjoyed the game but at a certain point I just wanted to get
                                    it over with.</p>

                                <p>This game is amazing.</p>
                                <p>The art style and world is great. Playing as pinnochio in a world full of evil
                                    puppets. The story is easy to follow, it's clear what you are there to do as you
                                    progress through the game. The world as a whole was dark and scary in places
                                    that seem like they used to be so bright and joyful.</p>
                                <p>The system in the game was just as you would expect from a soulslike game so
                                    there's not much to explain there. But one thing is that the game is more linear
                                    than a typical souls game, the game will always lead you to where you should go
                                    and you do bosses in a certain order.</p>
                                <p>The combat and movement were great and smooth, everything felt quick, responsive,
                                    and especially satisfying. I kind of wish there was more variety in the classes
                                    and weapons but nonetheless I enjoyed my dexterity run.</p>
                                <p>This game is amazing and does justice to the souls genre.</p>

                                <p>This game's art style is cute and simple. I did not think I would get as invested
                                    in this game as I did.</p>
                                <p>At first I didn't think too much of it but was still enjoying it. But the
                                    dialogue got me slightly more invested over time, a lot of the time it was funny
                                    but at times it got deep. The story was sad and had me attached.
                                <p>The "levels" were pretty creative, they weren't too difficult yet they were
                                    enjoyable. The combat was simple with it being a hack n slash type of game. And
                                    there wasn't much variety in weapons. The boss fights were pretty fun and had
                                    good variety in design and attacks.</p>
                                <p>Overall I enjoyed the game, my favorite part being the dialogue.</p>

                                <p>The art style in this game is 10/10. So cute and sick at the same time. One of my
                                    favorite parts.</p>
                                <p>The combat in this game was simple yet fun, the mechanics introduced over time
                                    made the combat more fun over time, letting you be more agile and try out
                                    different weapons.</pp>
                                <p>The world was fun to explore, I loved the secret passages all around, letting you
                                    take some shortcuts once you get through areas to help you traverse more
                                    quickly.</p>
                                <p>Some aspects were definitely souls inspired, like the fox statues acting as
                                    bonfires which also restored your flasks. Souls-like components are usually a
                                    plus for me.</p>
                                <p>I really enjoyed playing through this game.</p>

                                <p>As for the gameplay, it is pretty creative and fun at first. I grew bored of it
                                    after a few levels and mostly looked forward to the bosses. The game mostly felt

                                <p>As with most Mario games, this game had amazing sound and graphics.</p>
                                <p>I loved the new "mechanic" of the wonder seed which can add even more to a level or
                                    change
                                    the level completely. This provides a fun twist to each level instead of a more

                                    level where you know what to expect from the start.</p>
                                <p>One of my favorite parts of the game was definitely the badge challenges, levels
                                    based
                                    around mastering your use of each badge mechanic. And the special world was my
                                    absolute favorite part. I looked forward to progressing in the game just to get
                                    to these levels. All the levels in this world were rated of the hardest difficulty,
                                    according to the game itself. They provided a fun challenge.</p>
                                <p>I really enjoyed playing through this game and 100%-ing it.</p>

                                <p>The design and strategy of these levels still hold up in my eyes, regardless of the
                                    game
                                    now being 16 years old. Often I was stumped, wondering how I was supposed to
                                    continue.
                                </p>
                                <p>Sometimes I was even scared playing. The occasional gaps in the walls revealing
                                    hidden
                                    rooms, messages, and artwork provided eerie feelings as I snooped around trying to

                                    any secrets.</p>
                                <p>My favorite part had to be the final level, navigating through the facility, using

                                    skills learned to power through.</p>

                                <p>I can not imagine being a kid in 1985 trying to play this game and beat it. This game
                                    can
                                    be annoyingly difficult and the fact that you have to beat the game without losing
                                    your
                                    limited amount of lives is insane (though there is a secret button you can play to
                                    have
                                    checkpoints).</p>
                                <p>Besides that though, this game was quite simple and fun. And I could not
                                    stop playing until I beat the game. I spent lots of time trying to do it all in one
                                    run.
                                    There was a certain point though where I did end up using that secret checkpoint key
                                    in
                                    order to go back to the last world after wiping out.</p>
                                <p>I think I could come back to this
                                    game sometime and atttempt to do it all in one go. This very old game was solid and
                                    a
                                    fun few hours.</p>

                                <p>This was the second souls game I played (after elden ring) but the first I actually
                                    completed. I took a step back from Elden Ring (though I enjoyed it) and decided I
                                    wanted
                                    to appreciate the souls series as a whole, so I took on Dark Souls.</p>
                                <p>Right off the bat, this game gives me horror vibes. Spawning in a cell, navigating
                                    the
                                    close quarters of this prison area. Trying to fight these guards one on one while
                                    still
                                    trying to figure out who and where I am.</p>
                                <p>And honestly for most of the game, I am at the edge of my seat
                                    due to the possibility of enemies popping out of no where and just the overall
                                    artistic
                                    style of the game, most places seem like towns that were overrun that now are broken
                                    down and gloomy. But at the same time this game is graphically beautiful to me, but
                                    that
                                    might be because it is a remaster, but even then the art direction was spot on and
                                    the
                                    remaster looks great.</p>
                                <p>I enjoy the progression of souls games, defeating enemies along a
                                    path, slowly testing out and upgrading equipment/builts, and fighting the main boss
                                    of
                                    an area. It seems pretty simple thinking about it like that but I think it provides
                                    some
                                    freedom and fun to go at your own pace.</p>
                                <p>This game is fantastic to me.</p>

                                <p>After playing God of War (2018) I decided I wanted to give the whole series a try so

                                    went back to the first.</p>

                                    definitely a different gameplay experience from GoW 2018. It was somewhat fun at
                                    times
                                    combat wise, mostly just spamming stuff.</p>
                                <p>It seems like a pretty creative and fun game to start off the series, also impressive
                                    for
                                    it being made in 2005.</p>

                                <p>My first God of War game. And I think it was a great game to start the experience for
                                    me.
                                </p>

                                <p>This game has some beautiful graphics.</p>
                                <p>I enjoy the sort of slow pace from place to place, with a curious Atreus getting
                                    context
                                    about Kratos and what is going on in the world.</p>
                                <p>But after those moments you are solving small problems to progress and slashing any
                                    enemies in your way. The combat was pretty simple yet fun, I definitely kept it
                                    simple
                                    myself as I did not take advantage of most moves that I learned.</p>
                                <p>I also enjoyed trying to fight the Valkyries upon unlocking them. I think I only did
                                    2 or
                                    3 of them then decided it was enough.</p>
                                <p>I enjoyed playing this game, mostly only cared to do the main story. But this game
                                    inspired me to try the whole series.</p>

                                <p>I assumed this game would be similar to the first, and it basically was gameplay
                                    wise, and somewhat graphics wise</p>
                                <p>It was very creepy overall. But I did enjoy the design very much.</p>
                                <p>I liked solving the
                                    puzzles throughout the game all while feeling on edge the whole time as I never
                                    stopped
                                    being scared.</p>
                                <p>I enjoyed this game, there was probably some deep message I did not pick
                                    up on though.</p>

                                <p>I liked the puzzles more in this game than in Inside. I also like the full 2D-ness
                                    compared to Inside.</p>
                                <p>The black and white dark art style is nice. The game was a bit creepy and dark
                                    but it was pretty cool.</p>
