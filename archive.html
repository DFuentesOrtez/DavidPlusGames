                            <p>The art style in this game is 10/10. So cute and sick at the same time. One of my favorite parts.</p>
                            <p>The combat in this game was simple yet fun, the mechanics introduced over time made the combat more fun over time, letting you be more agile and try out different weapons.</pp>
                            <p>The world was fun to explore, I loved the secret passages all around, letting you take some shortcuts once you get through areas to help you traverse more quickly.</p>
                            <p>Some aspects were definitely souls inspired, like the fox statues acting as bonfires which also restored your flasks. Souls-like components are usually a plus for me.</p>
                            <p>I really enjoyed playing through this game.</p>

                            <p>I have not played Luigi's Mansion 1 or 2 (I hear 1 is the best), so this is my first.</p>
                            <p>This game is so cute and funny. Graphically one of the best games I have played so far on
                                the
                                Switch.</p>
                            <p>As for the gameplay, it is pretty creative and fun at first. I grew bored of it
                                after a few levels and mostly looked forward to the bosses. The game mostly felt
                                repetitive
                                and I got tired of the slow exploration that felt pointless.</p>

                            <p>As with most Mario games, this game had amazing sound and graphics.</p>
                            <p>I loved the new "mechanic" of the wonder seed which can add even more to a level or
                                change
                                the level completely. This provides a fun twist to each level instead of a more generic
                                level where you know what to expect from the start.</p>
                            <p>One of my favorite parts of the game was definitely the badge challenges, levels based
                                around mastering your use of each badge mechanic. And the special world was my
                                absolute favorite part. I looked forward to progressing in the game just to get
                                to these levels. All the levels in this world were rated of the hardest difficulty,
                                according to the game itself. They provided a fun challenge.</p>
                            <p>I really enjoyed playing through this game and 100%-ing it.</p>

                            <p>This is my second experience with Portal. The first being with the Portal 2 Coop.</p>
                            <p>The design and strategy of these levels still hold up in my eyes, regardless of the game
                                now being 16 years old. Often I was stumped, wondering how I was supposed to continue.
                            </p>
                            <p>Sometimes I was even scared playing. The occasional gaps in the walls revealing hidden
                                rooms, messages, and artwork provided eerie feelings as I snooped around trying to find
                                any secrets.</p>
                            <p>My favorite part had to be the final level, navigating through the facility, using the
                                skills learned to power through.</p>
                            <p>Just glad the cake was not a lie.</p>

                            <p>I can not imagine being a kid in 1985 trying to play this game and beat it. This game can
                                be annoyingly difficult and the fact that you have to beat the game without losing your
                                limited amount of lives is insane (though there is a secret button you can play to have
                                checkpoints).</p>
                            <p>Besides that though, this game was quite simple and fun. And I could not
                                stop playing until I beat the game. I spent lots of time trying to do it all in one run.
                                There was a certain point though where I did end up using that secret checkpoint key in
                                order to go back to the last world after wiping out.</p>
                            <p>I think I could come back to this
                                game sometime and atttempt to do it all in one go. This very old game was solid and a
                                fun few hours.</p>

                        <div class="thoughts">
                            <p>This was the second souls game I played (after elden ring) but the first I actually
                                completed. I took a step back from Elden Ring (though I enjoyed it) and decided I wanted
                                to appreciate the souls series as a whole, so I took on Dark Souls.</p>
                            <p>Right off the bat, this game gives me horror vibes. Spawning in a cell, navigating the
                                close quarters of this prison area. Trying to fight these guards one on one while still
                                trying to figure out who and where I am.</p>
                            <p>And honestly for most of the game, I am at the edge of my seat
                                due to the possibility of enemies popping out of no where and just the overall artistic
                                style of the game, most places seem like towns that were overrun that now are broken
                                down and gloomy. But at the same time this game is graphically beautiful to me, but that
                                might be because it is a remaster, but even then the art direction was spot on and the
                                remaster looks great.</p>
                            <p>I enjoy the progression of souls games, defeating enemies along a
                                path, slowly testing out and upgrading equipment/builts, and fighting the main boss of
                                an area. It seems pretty simple thinking about it like that but I think it provides some
                                freedom and fun to go at your own pace.</p>
                            <p>This game is fantastic to me.</p>

                            <p>My 105 hours in the game were in 3 weeks. I was having so much fun within that time
                                period. I even put in 55 more hours in this game than BotW.</p>
                            <p>I had a blast, this is a great game.</p>
                            <p>Though it was just really BotW expanded.</p>

                            <p>After playing God of War (2018) I decided I wanted to give the whole series a try so I
                                went back to the first.</p>
                            <p>I was not sure what to expect from this game but it was
                                definitely a different gameplay experience from GoW 2018. It was somewhat fun at times
                                combat wise, mostly just spamming stuff.</p>
                            <p>It seems like a pretty creative and fun game to start off the series, also impressive for
                                it being made in 2005.</p>
                            <p>I enjoyed playing this game.</p>

                            <p>My first God of War game. And I think it was a great game to start the experience for me.
                            </p>

                            <p>This game has some beautiful graphics.</p>
                            <p>I enjoy the sort of slow pace from place to place, with a curious Atreus getting context
                                about Kratos and what is going on in the world.</p>
                            <p>But after those moments you are solving small problems to progress and slashing any
                                enemies in your way. The combat was pretty simple yet fun, I definitely kept it simple
                                myself as I did not take advantage of most moves that I learned.</p>
                            <p>I also enjoyed trying to fight the Valkyries upon unlocking them. I think I only did 2 or
                                3 of them then decided it was enough.</p>
                            <p>I enjoyed playing this game, mostly only cared to do the main story. But this game
                                inspired me to try the whole series.</p>

                            <p>I decided to put these together since I played them back to back and they are pretty
                                similar. Also I do not know when I started/finished either of these.</p>
                            <h2>Limbo</h2>
                            <p>I had no idea what to expect from this game but it was a new experience.</p>
                            <p>I liked the puzzles more in this game than in Inside. I also like the full 2D-ness
                                compared to Inside.</p>
                            <p>The black and white dark art style is nice. The game was a bit creepy and dark
                                but it was pretty cool.</p>
                            <p>I enjoyed playing this game.</p>
                            <h2>Inside</h2>
                            <p>I assumed this game would be similar to the first, and it basically was gameplay
                                wise, and somewhat graphics wise</p>
                            <p>It was very creepy overall. But I did enjoy the design very much.</p>
                            <p>I liked solving the
                                puzzles throughout the game all while feeling on edge the whole time as I never stopped
                                being scared.</p>
                            <p>I enjoyed this game, there was probably some deep message I did not pick
                                up on though.</p>

                            <p>The combat in this game was simple yet fun, the mechanics introduced over time made the combat more fun over time, letting you be more agile and try out different weapons.</pp>
                            <p>The world was fun to explore, I loved the secret passages all around, letting you take some shortcuts once you get through areas to help you traverse more quickly.</p>
                            <p>Some aspects were definitely souls inspired, like the fox statues acting as bonfires which also restored your flasks. Souls-like components are usually a plus for me.</p>
